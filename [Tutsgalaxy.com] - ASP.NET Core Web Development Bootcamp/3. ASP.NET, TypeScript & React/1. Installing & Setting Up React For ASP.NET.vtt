WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:05.160
Hey guys what's up with this story of what we're going to be doing is showing you how to get up and

00:05.160 --> 00:12.360
running with a basic high speed on a Web site as well as using re-act babbling well-packed which is

00:12.360 --> 00:14.520
really the three tools you're going to use a lot.

00:14.520 --> 00:20.700
Whenever you're going to be writing Riak code you're going to be able to compile your javascript and

00:20.700 --> 00:23.410
your notes on the web in order to be able to handle your modules.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.640
And we'll get into that more as we go into this.

00:25.660 --> 00:30.690
But it isn't just going to be pretty much a one video demonstration of how you would want to merge it

00:30.690 --> 00:36.280
really just give a suggestion of how you could set up your project to use both speed and reacting and

00:36.720 --> 00:38.120
with speed on that.

00:38.340 --> 00:43.620
We're obviously going to be using C-Sharp which is Microsoft's flagship language it's their most popular

00:44.130 --> 00:50.190
language by far and I wrote one of his top five languages out right now probably.

00:50.260 --> 00:53.680
So in order to be able to follow along on this you're going to need to have something to write your

00:53.680 --> 00:54.130
code in.

00:54.130 --> 00:59.590
And since we're using XP now you're probably going to want to use Visual Studio and there's a free version

00:59.590 --> 01:02.390
so you can download that here at this web page.

01:02.410 --> 01:06.070
You can also get that done at Corbridge ever using actually gotten that 4.5.

01:06.070 --> 01:12.360
I've not done that core but the it will come with your install so just go out and make sure you have

01:12.370 --> 01:14.110
Visual Studio installed.

01:14.650 --> 01:18.060
The next thing you're going to need is you don't need to have no chance install because that's how we're

01:18.070 --> 01:21.050
going installing tools like battling with pack and react.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.400
So make sure both of these aren't all of your machine.

01:23.410 --> 01:24.480
I'm going to be using Windows.

01:24.500 --> 01:30.230
We can probably follow along just fine on a Mac or Linux machine to.

01:30.270 --> 01:34.050
So once you have Visual Studio installed and I went ahead and opened it here you would be greeted with

01:34.050 --> 01:42.130
this start page and it's what we're going to do is just go to file new and create a new project and

01:42.130 --> 01:47.980
then inside here what I'm going to do is just you can highlight web if you want so you have less options

01:47.980 --> 01:48.670
to deal with.

01:48.790 --> 01:51.940
And we're not going to be using Corrigan reviews and gotten that 4.5.

01:51.940 --> 01:54.850
So that's why I'm selecting this version here.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.420
You're going to want to go out and create a place to put it here.

01:58.420 --> 02:03.120
I'm not going to use a repository that's just beyond the scope of this.

02:03.160 --> 02:11.320
This tutorial here I like to put my projects in a folder on my C drive just so I have a safe place to

02:11.320 --> 02:12.760
reference them and put them right in here.

02:12.760 --> 02:19.280
So I have a C-sharp folder already here something I go it and just select the folder and here the name.

02:19.280 --> 02:26.570
This is the name of the project that you're going to be titling so for your case it's going to be react.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.530
I don't know I guess I'll just call re-act demo.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.260
I click OK.

02:32.850 --> 02:35.070
And now here what we want to do is like to MVC.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.510
But we're going to do actually running on empty.

02:37.620 --> 02:40.500
We don't want to have any of the boilerplate or any of the stuff that it comes with.

02:40.600 --> 02:44.020
So we just get it empty empty website.

02:44.020 --> 02:45.750
I'm not going to add unit tests.

02:45.810 --> 02:51.620
That's probably beyond the scope of what I'm trying to demonstrate here so let's just select the empty

02:51.980 --> 02:53.580
click OK.

02:59.180 --> 03:04.520
Our answer here didn't set up the project for us there's not much here on the right hand right hand

03:04.520 --> 03:04.910
side here.

03:04.910 --> 03:09.580
The solution explores where are your actual contents of your project are located.

03:09.810 --> 03:13.700
There's a lot of Microsoft specific stuff in here that might be confusing if you've never gotten started

03:13.700 --> 03:15.580
with has been on that before.

03:15.660 --> 03:19.090
Like the web config and just.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.240
Well that's probably because it's empty.

03:21.290 --> 03:22.720
There's not going be too much confusing stuff.

03:22.730 --> 03:26.870
But how do we have selected the regular is put on that Web site you can have authentication and everything

03:26.870 --> 03:33.270
all built in it working for you and that can be sometimes difficult to figure out what's going on there.

03:33.290 --> 03:37.880
But let's go ahead and create our controller because what we want to do is when the application starts

03:37.880 --> 03:41.250
we want to just go ahead and have an initial reading page.

03:41.480 --> 03:49.920
So I'm going to go ahead and write a book on the project and I'll just say and I say nubes scaffold

03:49.920 --> 03:54.810
that item and we want to grab an NBC control and we're just going to say that it's empty.

03:55.950 --> 03:58.180
And we'll call it the default control or that's fine.

04:10.810 --> 04:14.860
So I went ahead and added quite a bit of stuff that our project needs because now that it knows that

04:14.860 --> 04:21.850
you were to the controller it's like oh we need to add all this other stuff like Route config.

04:22.180 --> 04:26.590
We'll get into that in just a second but this is actually how your application is able to hit the controllers

04:26.590 --> 04:28.570
that you add to the project.

04:28.590 --> 04:32.660
This just explains how the routing is supposed to work because you can customize that quite a bit.

04:32.980 --> 04:37.060
But we're not going to get into too much of this basic stuff and really it's not basic at all it's just

04:37.060 --> 04:39.790
it's what every project and aspect on need.

04:39.790 --> 04:45.900
So at least from VC dot net and just we don't need to dissect all those pieces here.

04:45.910 --> 04:50.850
We just want to get in and get moving on because this is mostly about how to integrate react with your

04:50.890 --> 04:52.660
input on a project.

04:53.510 --> 04:59.470
So let's go ahead and up in the controller's folder there is now the default controller and you can

04:59.470 --> 05:01.400
see that we're turning this view.

05:01.660 --> 05:08.290
So we have just one index and in order to return something because right now we're going to return essentially

05:08.290 --> 05:14.280
nothing because there is no view and the default folder down here in the view.

05:14.290 --> 05:20.440
So we want to create a shortcut to be able to do that if you have this control or file writing hover

05:20.440 --> 05:26.160
over view and right click and then just say add a view and then here this is all going to go with the

05:26.170 --> 05:26.710
default.

05:26.710 --> 05:33.040
We want to have the index match the the method name which is indexed so make sure that those those because

05:33.040 --> 05:37.100
it has data has to match up otherwise it's not going to go to find the right template.

05:37.530 --> 05:42.960
And we also want to have this use a layout page selected So we're going to go ahead and select the layout

05:42.980 --> 05:46.750
page that supposed to use and that's going to be right here.

05:47.170 --> 05:50.530
And the reason why we use lay out pages is just for code reuse.

05:50.530 --> 05:54.520
That way if there's a lot of stuff that all the pages share you can have that sitting in the layout

05:54.550 --> 06:01.570
and just have the you know the pages that derive from that not use everything or not have to duplicate

06:01.570 --> 06:07.480
all that stuff it's in the layout because it just uses the layout plus you know the additional code.

06:07.510 --> 06:09.440
I'll just want that more detail.

06:09.450 --> 06:10.140
Good point.

06:10.150 --> 06:14.200
And so this is going to add or review and you can see now under the default folder where used to be

06:14.250 --> 06:17.900
indicators how an index file and this is going to be.

06:18.030 --> 06:20.800
What has changed is to react Tauriel

06:25.030 --> 06:30.280
and inside here this is actually called Razor syntax you know.

06:30.300 --> 06:35.380
In fact if you've never used the on that you probably want to follow along on a different tutorial before

06:35.380 --> 06:39.840
you even get to this because this is mostly once again about how to integrate react with

06:43.730 --> 06:49.840
I able to do those customize this layout folder or the layout file also inside shared the layout.

06:49.940 --> 06:54.090
We're going to take on some of the stuff that I don't want in the project right now.

06:54.110 --> 06:58.360
Take out those two lines down here of integrating get rid of this stuff here.

06:58.430 --> 07:00.540
We do want this render section down here.

07:00.560 --> 07:05.840
So I do want to keep that in I also want to copy this line and I'm gonna put it at the top of the head

07:05.870 --> 07:06.770
here.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.660
We're actually at the bottom of the head.

07:08.810 --> 07:12.200
And inside we're going to change the name of it.

07:12.430 --> 07:15.820
And the reason why is because we want to have two sections that we're going to use that we have the

07:15.860 --> 07:21.310
footer section and the head section and that's all we're going here.

07:21.350 --> 07:25.650
We got to change your application and so will say retire.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.560
Obviously it's still to me.

07:28.580 --> 07:28.840
All right.

07:28.860 --> 07:32.540
And go out and just click play but before we do that let's

07:38.050 --> 07:39.180
let's go and click on

08:06.210 --> 08:08.190
things that kind of slow.

08:08.980 --> 08:16.140
So what finally actually opens up we don't have this this rube file pointing to our default template

08:16.140 --> 08:20.140
but if we went ahead and we did a forward slash and just the default for the name of our controller

08:20.140 --> 08:21.150
that we created.

08:21.150 --> 08:26.520
Now you're actually going to hit the tutorial that we changed and because we took out all the seats

08:26.700 --> 08:32.310
and everything like there's no there's no styling here so let's get it fixed that real quick and just

08:32.310 --> 08:36.920
so we know what's going on inside the layout.

08:36.990 --> 08:43.470
I'm going to go ahead and go to the contact folder and we want to try again bootstrap and then under

08:43.470 --> 08:45.420
that we also want a dragon in the site.

08:45.430 --> 08:51.720
Yes now this was actually happening under the covers but wanted to explain really just I didn't want

08:51.720 --> 08:57.090
any sort of magic when I just wanted to be very explicit about what files and everything are being loaded

08:57.780 --> 08:59.540
because we're using bootstrap.

08:59.610 --> 09:06.180
We also need to actually use both J-20 and whose sharp bootstrap require Shinwari.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.150
So let's go ahead and bring that in.

09:08.150 --> 09:14.250
First of all you have to do is just click and hold and it will actually map it for you and everything

09:15.040 --> 09:17.180
and then drag and bootstrap here.

09:19.210 --> 09:19.380
All right.

09:19.400 --> 09:26.580
So we should be able to just close it down so let's just go out and stop it and rerun it so that we

09:26.590 --> 09:28.460
can open in the browser.

09:34.830 --> 09:38.580
And you can see that we have a much better styling this time and it's even responsive so that you have

09:38.580 --> 09:41.890
the responsive navigation which there is no items there.

09:41.910 --> 09:47.040
But any way that that is working.

09:47.220 --> 09:52.400
So we want to fix that issue where it's opening up the first page and it's not actually finding it.

09:52.400 --> 09:58.490
What we do is go into our config which is in the app store folder and we go click on that.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.810
Inside this is instantiation code right here.

10:01.810 --> 10:06.000
Well we want to do is adding another argument which is controller and then we're going to with the name

10:06.000 --> 10:10.480
of the controller that we wanted to default to which was our default controller.

10:11.310 --> 10:14.790
And then now we go out and start it it's actually once you find that default controller.

10:14.790 --> 10:16.660
So we want to put that in the user.

10:16.690 --> 10:21.660
We can just find it for us and go right there from the root directory.

10:21.750 --> 10:22.050
There

10:25.190 --> 10:26.910
is another we have that out of the way.

10:26.910 --> 10:32.510
Let's go into our project folder structure here.

10:32.530 --> 10:36.680
And what I want to do inside the scripts is actually where I'm going to put our re-asked project.

10:36.700 --> 10:40.370
I'm going to create a folder inside of here and we're just going to pull it out.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.200
We have folder

10:43.900 --> 10:46.770
and let's go to navigate to where that's located.

11:04.360 --> 11:09.080
So here's the whole reactor in my folder so if I if I go you can send to send some of my projects for

11:09.090 --> 11:09.450
you right.

11:09.450 --> 11:10.750
Put this project.

11:11.100 --> 11:19.960
So if I go inside all of the scripts scripts scripts scripts scripts Well then I'm going to go inside

11:19.970 --> 11:27.780
it react folder and this address bar type in cmd and it's going to be a shortcut to open up your command

11:27.780 --> 11:30.000
prompt to that folder.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.510
Now what I want you to do is if you install the nodes like you like I told her to be getting in the

11:34.510 --> 11:39.820
video then you can when you type in MPO it should actually pull up information NPM as a package manager

11:40.110 --> 11:45.600
and it allows us to install things like reacted so that it's going to reach across the web and grab

11:45.600 --> 11:50.400
the latest we are coding and it handles like dependencies that certain projects need.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.960
So that's why we needed to install it.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.870
No because we needed the tool.

11:54.870 --> 12:00.930
So if you get information like this that means that you've installed PM and node correctly so you can

12:00.930 --> 12:05.950
continue it 90 degrees and reinstall that so that you can get that working and the first thing we need

12:06.010 --> 12:09.340
do inside this folder now is we're going to create an initialization file.

12:09.510 --> 12:10.820
So and then it follow.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.280
So let's go and do that.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.120
Now we're going to say NPM and I'll make this a little better.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.200
So you guys can see

12:22.010 --> 12:28.150
all right so sit down here the search string is all right there you go.

12:28.260 --> 12:35.400
So we're going to type them here which is short for initialization which is what we don't want to call

12:35.410 --> 12:38.470
it re-act actually what just call a tutorial.

12:38.580 --> 12:44.620
So that's the name of the project that I'm going to reference and what the say version 1.0 that's ok

12:44.880 --> 12:48.130
I will say it works.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.900
Yes.

12:55.650 --> 13:00.750
Now here is the starting point for our STARTING POINT actually yes.

13:00.810 --> 13:05.270
And don't worry about the test command or the great repository or keywords and I'll put my name in there

13:05.280 --> 13:10.320
you can put your own name and it will get in my TV license and that's good.

13:10.320 --> 13:14.510
All right so now that we've done that they created this package that a song folder.

13:14.640 --> 13:20.310
Now in order to write code you're going to need to get a better editor and Visual Studio.

13:20.310 --> 13:27.160
So unfortunately the support and Visual Studio at least for 2015 it certainly didn't work.

13:27.810 --> 13:32.000
Let's go and try visual studio first and see how ugly it is.

13:32.310 --> 13:37.770
But inside this art project folder inside the reactor you can see that there's nothing that looks like

13:37.770 --> 13:42.450
there's nothing inside Rockfeller even though we can see that we just created a file called package

13:42.450 --> 13:47.290
that Jason and and there but it's not showing up in Visual Studio the reason why you need to click this

13:47.290 --> 13:52.800
little button at the top does it show all files and then you can see it showing you that this package

13:52.920 --> 13:54.660
is some files in the project.

13:54.870 --> 13:58.470
But because it's great like that it's not included in the project.

13:58.770 --> 14:01.470
So in order to do that we want to right click and include in the project.

14:01.470 --> 14:08.130
And the reason why certain files are included and not included is like you'll see in the second when

14:08.130 --> 14:13.140
we go and install no that we don't necessarily want everything and all of these folders to be added

14:13.140 --> 14:17.990
to our project and having you know Visual Studio have to keep track of the files and things like that.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.750
And I'll explain that more in just a second or you'll see why.

14:21.960 --> 14:26.160
But inside this package I sounds like this is going to be responsible for keeping track of all your

14:26.160 --> 14:26.820
dependencies.

14:26.820 --> 14:32.130
So when we install react react has dependencies on all kinds of other different projects that it's going

14:32.130 --> 14:33.480
to install for us.

14:33.840 --> 14:38.400
And that's why it makes that so much easier to get things like re-active working.

14:38.830 --> 14:47.060
And so we'll see in just a second here that this is this file is going to grow as we install stuff.

14:47.100 --> 14:54.300
So the first thing is let's go out and install a reactor and we're going to NPM install hyphen hyphen

14:54.300 --> 15:06.190
where you say save and Aleksei react in space react to.

15:06.300 --> 15:06.520
All right.

15:06.550 --> 15:10.480
So once again this is reaching across the web it's going to install in all the different dependencies

15:10.480 --> 15:16.930
and everything because we did save it's actually going to add those two things that we install to our

15:16.930 --> 15:17.930
dependencies.

15:18.060 --> 15:20.220
The location of this config file.

15:20.350 --> 15:24.250
And that's why I was telling you that it keeps track of the versions that you have because if you have

15:24.250 --> 15:30.520
Riak sixteen point two you can't have react sixteen point five or fourteen point something or another

15:30.820 --> 15:32.070
you're going to have all kinds of problems.

15:32.070 --> 15:39.040
But NPM is actually following the dependency structure pretty well.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.230
So it handles all that for us.

15:41.620 --> 15:46.870
Now what I want to show you because I was telling you about the reason why you don't want to have all

15:46.870 --> 15:53.590
these files included in Visual Studio is now there's no modules folder which all these different things

15:53.590 --> 15:55.120
got installed into.

15:55.630 --> 16:00.680
And the reason why was because we install re-occupy re-act has all these weapons.

16:00.700 --> 16:06.920
So all this stuff has to actually be downloaded as well in order for react to be able to work and react.

16:06.940 --> 16:11.440
So even though we didn't say to install these things they did anyway because they need to be there in

16:11.440 --> 16:13.300
order for react to work.

16:13.630 --> 16:19.090
And if we go back to Visual Studio and we refreshed you can see the modules forward but I'm not going

16:19.090 --> 16:23.440
to and include that one because there's just too much stuff in there I don't want Visual Studio keeping

16:23.440 --> 16:28.720
track of Visual Studio is a memory pig so that thing can run out of memory at any random time and just

16:28.720 --> 16:30.400
like crash happens all the time.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.260
Ask any Windows developer.

16:33.020 --> 16:37.080
I see another way that we need to go and install a few other things and these are our development tools

16:37.090 --> 16:41.860
so instead of actually saying that the way dependencies are actually a development dependency as we're

16:41.860 --> 16:47.010
working on this project so we're going to say him install and see because it's a development dependency

16:47.100 --> 16:49.870
and save save instead of just save.

16:50.170 --> 16:56.390
And now I need to add a battle for another.

16:56.390 --> 17:06.100
It's confusing is the BS over here but it's core battle loader and they need to have a space between

17:06.100 --> 17:07.370
all these things.

17:07.760 --> 17:19.380
But hack for say Fauvel research and B and then Babel three said Riyadh's

17:22.750 --> 17:23.560
All right that should be everything.

17:23.560 --> 17:28.510
So we click enter it's going to go on install those as the development dependencies are going to pause

17:28.510 --> 17:33.190
the video because that's a lot it's going to have to download a lot for that.

17:33.400 --> 17:39.860
Next thing we need to do now is go ahead and we need to add a new file to the reactor folder called

17:40.490 --> 17:42.560
our config file.

17:42.740 --> 17:47.170
We're seeing right on the javascript file.

17:47.170 --> 17:53.560
So you say well God can.

17:54.570 --> 18:01.930
God yes so inside of here when to paste this answer just pause the video for Say him in Chicago don't

18:01.930 --> 18:04.870
copy that she put in just a second copy.

18:05.110 --> 18:09.110
What we're doing here is we're actually setting up this configuration file with packets going to use

18:09.720 --> 18:12.340
and let's see

18:17.020 --> 18:21.100
actually know that all of this should be fine.

18:21.280 --> 18:30.760
The entry point is going to be our chess story and then we want our output to be.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.270
And this distributor will keep the output like this.

18:34.270 --> 18:35.670
Let's go ahead and test this out.

18:35.680 --> 18:42.430
It was a new dodgiest file to this because that's going to be the starting point says entry point I

18:42.430 --> 18:43.650
was looking for.

18:48.460 --> 18:53.640
Actually has final insight here we're just going to use some sort of new standard some syntax.

18:53.650 --> 18:56.130
This is a new feature

18:59.000 --> 18:59.800
series.

18:59.880 --> 19:07.140
So you want to write the latest javascript then you want to use keywords like Konstanz where aero functions

19:07.140 --> 19:08.020
and things like that.

19:08.070 --> 19:12.990
Some of the latest version or some of the latest standards are the jobs we're playing with it doesn't

19:13.170 --> 19:14.380
it doesn't work and all the browser.

19:14.380 --> 19:20.190
So that's why that was going to allow us to be able to write in the latest form of javascript which

19:20.190 --> 19:22.750
includes classes and things like that.

19:23.130 --> 19:28.590
And it's going to compile it or process it down to older javascript that still works in the browser

19:28.620 --> 19:33.750
but it does it for us so we can still write modern javascript but have it work in older browsers and

19:34.170 --> 19:36.890
that's why we're actually setting up all these tools.

19:37.110 --> 19:41.190
You'll see also that it's actually it's pretty imperative that you have these tools in place because

19:41.760 --> 19:46.890
most of the tutorials in the documentation you're going to see on re-act these days they're using classes

19:46.890 --> 19:49.940
and things like that which means that you have to have that will.

19:50.160 --> 19:54.720
And another thing too is when you're writing jazz that's not stuff it's got it's impossible to do any

19:54.720 --> 19:56.080
of that stuff.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.170
And just straight javascript I mean you have to be a ninja.

20:00.780 --> 20:03.350
So we're going to using GSX and you'll see what that is.

20:03.360 --> 20:09.980
And you know you're going to react and everything but the babble makes all that possible.

20:09.990 --> 20:14.760
All right so let's go back to our packaged sound file what we need to do onto the scripts we need to

20:14.760 --> 20:21.350
actually tell it how to execute that because we didn't install impact globally.

20:21.630 --> 20:23.440
We want to get it here.

20:23.700 --> 20:33.090
And this basically just tells of NPM hey I'm going to look inside my node modules folder from from the

20:33.090 --> 20:36.030
same folder of where this config file is located.

20:36.030 --> 20:40.770
So it just automatically knows to look in node modules for the well-packed that we install and not some

20:40.770 --> 20:42.230
global version.

20:42.690 --> 20:45.760
So that's why we're adding it to the script model here.

20:45.830 --> 20:49.590
And if everything goes well we're going to see this and try to compile this and now we're going to say

20:49.680 --> 20:52.240
NPRM run pack.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.520
And it did not.

20:55.530 --> 20:56.540
All right.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.320
The reason why it's not working is our config file here.

21:04.340 --> 21:06.660
I'm sorry I missed the module.

21:06.740 --> 21:15.540
I was just copying this from the web page and when you say modularize for us I if you can see that Visual

21:15.540 --> 21:20.100
Studio is even trying to warn me of that that it was complaining because in order for this file to actually

21:20.100 --> 21:24.230
be usable by one that needs to be exported so it can import it.

21:24.570 --> 21:27.210
All right let's go back here to try.

21:28.020 --> 21:33.670
See now you can see that it did and went ahead and compile it put out the bundled Yes.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.680
So we go inside here.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.720
Refresh.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.780
We're now going to have that.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.960
There's another reason why you don't have to know my father.

21:40.960 --> 21:45.750
Look at all the stuff that's now and I know there's a time but now you know this disk folder and we

21:45.750 --> 21:51.120
do want the disks involved in the project something to say are included projects.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.410
So inside here you can see this is a bundle file.

21:53.430 --> 21:56.620
This was created for us by web pack.

21:57.030 --> 22:00.960
And now this was just one pack that did it for us.

22:01.050 --> 22:06.690
And you can see that it's still using cost and cost doesn't work and all the browsers so we didn't actually

22:06.690 --> 22:15.720
use babbly Babble's not being used by well-packed So what we need to do now is add that portion to our

22:16.950 --> 22:19.620
page.

22:19.620 --> 22:25.020
All right so going to be copying this as well and we're after the output here.

22:25.020 --> 22:31.040
Put a comma and a minute pases and we're adding this module and this actually tells it to use Babolat

22:31.040 --> 22:38.720
we want to change a few things because we're not using Balram and I get them removed and we do want

22:38.730 --> 22:39.900
to say use Battletoads.

22:39.900 --> 22:46.370
Also this needs to be and this needs to be powerful prisa.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.280
And if you remember earlier we installed that and we also installed react.

22:50.400 --> 22:58.680
So we need to save babbel preset react and react uses a syntax called GSX which is like this hybrid

22:58.680 --> 23:01.070
of HCM and Javascript.

23:01.350 --> 23:06.570
And the thing is is that it has to be compiled to regular Javascript.

23:06.810 --> 23:14.190
So Babbo can do that for you but you need to have a preset react and you need to tell them how to use

23:14.190 --> 23:16.740
that and that's why we're actually setting that up here.

23:16.740 --> 23:20.510
So this is not going to well should work.

23:20.610 --> 23:23.920
Let's go ahead and check this out here.

23:25.990 --> 23:29.720
I want to make sure there's no problems now when we run this with the config.

23:30.040 --> 23:34.870
I know one thing that you'll notice it's actually annoying that we have to actually run this every time

23:34.870 --> 23:35.800
we want to build it.

23:35.820 --> 23:40.230
We'll see in just a moment that we can do something that continually have it watch for any changes that

23:40.260 --> 23:46.120
we may think that will even do that now.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.710
So it's hard for the modules as well.

23:48.770 --> 23:52.470
I say when I say it was an true.

23:53.030 --> 24:00.950
So now that we've gone out we go ahead and we've run our Instead of just stopping it is now waiting.

24:01.030 --> 24:09.410
And if we look here let's go going to make a change so that what happens where I can pick up on it.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.240
So watch on the left hand side.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.750
So as we make it change here

24:21.070 --> 24:24.260
I'm going out of control as the saver.

24:24.350 --> 24:30.560
And you can see that has picked up on it and it really compiled and it now has a new bango file that

24:30.560 --> 24:33.440
it's created and you can see that this is now out.

24:33.440 --> 24:38.210
Now another thing you can tell the Babble's now working because it took out the constants keywords and

24:38.210 --> 24:43.670
it's using the strict mode which this is all older versions of javascript that still work in the browser.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.280
And that's why Babel.

24:45.290 --> 24:53.030
You can see this now it's not compiling correctly for us now to see react in an example.

24:53.440 --> 24:57.140
Let's go ahead and add something here.

25:01.760 --> 25:08.620
And I'm just going to type and react to Tauriel because this isn't a specific way re-acting tutorials

25:08.780 --> 25:10.910
set up at least at this point.

25:10.970 --> 25:17.550
So when I use some of their getting started code to get our feet wet as well.

25:25.580 --> 25:28.430
Right this is what I was looking for other documentation here.

25:28.460 --> 25:35.080
What I do is I want to copy this file here or at least that portion and we're going to go to digest

25:35.130 --> 25:36.220
and get rid of all of that.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.850
And now we're going to save that.

25:37.850 --> 25:41.960
Now this is the GSX code that I was telling you about the browser has no idea what the hell this is

25:41.990 --> 25:45.760
and nor does javascript javascript and can't compile this.

25:46.130 --> 25:52.040
But what it does is with the reactive development extension for example it's going to take this GSX

25:52.060 --> 25:56.560
code and turn into regular javascript that's going to compile the javascript to the older javascript

25:56.570 --> 25:59.060
so it does all that magic for us on the fly.

25:59.060 --> 26:06.200
So if I go ahead and save it and you look inside the bundle file now you can see that there's quite

26:06.200 --> 26:11.420
a bit more in here now than what we had before because all this stuff like it just went ahead and said

26:11.450 --> 26:15.200
oh you're using react and all that stuff said OK now I need to bring in the right project I need to

26:15.200 --> 26:20.240
bring in the reactor project and just a lot of stuff going on there.

26:20.300 --> 26:26.540
Now this is an important part now in order for Iraq to actually be rendered what we need to do is we

26:26.540 --> 26:32.570
need to say OK this document Dockett get element by the route we need to take note of that because what

26:32.570 --> 26:41.750
we're going to do is add that ID to our Web page so that we can bind this component to the root node

26:42.470 --> 26:44.930
and it's best to just give a demonstration.

26:44.930 --> 26:50.680
So inside here is great credit where and we're on all this group and how they reacted.

26:50.690 --> 26:53.960
Like you said it will render all its code inside this element.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.950
Now we also need to say is

27:02.640 --> 27:10.520
we need to add our our bundle file to this index file here in order for it to actually work.

27:10.520 --> 27:18.900
So let's say as we say at symbol an intersection and if you remember from or lay out a section for the

27:18.900 --> 27:21.780
footer was called scripts.

27:21.790 --> 27:27.170
So that's what we're going to be standing here as we're in the safes section

27:30.960 --> 27:32.180
it just like that.

27:32.290 --> 27:41.970
And then inside here this is what we're going to do right in our bundle.

27:42.370 --> 27:47.530
And you want to make sure it's in the script because with this Bondo you want to do it on every all

27:47.530 --> 27:50.040
the elements everything alone before this file actually.

27:50.080 --> 27:57.880
That's why we put it here just before the the closing about e-tag.

27:57.900 --> 28:10.780
All right so now let's go ahead and run the project.

28:10.880 --> 28:11.090
All right.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.090
And we have hello world.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.780
Now this is actually being rendered by reacts.

28:14.820 --> 28:25.450
If I right click doctors at the bottom here you can see that the root now has this H-1 the hello world

28:25.450 --> 28:26.640
that we added to it.

28:26.650 --> 28:30.310
And that is all inside this right here.

28:30.320 --> 28:34.180
So if we were to change this to something else we could do that.

28:34.180 --> 28:40.240
In fact what we'll see in future trials I'm going to do on react.

28:40.560 --> 28:44.080
There's quite a bit to do here now reality is now actually working.

28:44.080 --> 28:50.240
So this is you know for example really of how you get along with re-act working.

28:50.260 --> 28:57.130
And once again you guys tune into my story I'm going to go into the building quite a bit of stuff with

28:57.130 --> 29:02.740
react but this whole initial set up some of the biggest pain I think to getting involved in a lot of

29:02.740 --> 29:07.040
modern client side development these days the technology changes.

29:07.050 --> 29:10.190
I've done videos on this subject.

29:10.530 --> 29:15.420
Not even a year ago and they're already out of date so things just got to be so quick with some of this

29:15.420 --> 29:15.660
stuff.

29:15.670 --> 29:19.180
But the initial set up is generally the hardest part.

29:19.180 --> 29:23.470
And then from there you can really start you know looking at a lot of examples online a lot of tutorials

29:23.470 --> 29:28.370
like mine like books things like that that will really help you along because a lot of the syntax of

29:28.370 --> 29:32.830
reactor itself isn't changing but the tools and everything you use for your project do change quite

29:32.830 --> 29:34.880
a bit.

29:34.930 --> 29:40.410
Now one thing I will suggest also when you're doing re-act development there is a Chrome extension and

29:40.410 --> 29:43.320
you should check that out of this re-act developer tools.

29:43.380 --> 29:45.760
You absolutely need it if you're going to use reductio.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.380
You have to use that tool as well.

29:47.390 --> 29:52.120
If you're just going to pull your hair out with some of the debugging things you don't make your life

29:52.120 --> 29:56.440
any more difficult than it has to be when you're dealing with some of the stuff like that this is going

29:56.440 --> 29:58.710
to make your life easier.

29:58.760 --> 30:02.090
Now let's see I could probably close this town

30:19.190 --> 30:25.810
right now if we right clicking means that we now have this re-act component and you can see re-act tells

30:25.810 --> 30:31.330
you oh hey I have one component which is just a typical H-1 and you can see it's children on the props

30:31.430 --> 30:37.920
and it's kind of small but this is going to help you a great deal and you'll see when I started doing

30:37.920 --> 30:44.670
the reactor Royal all alone as your stuff gets more and more complicated this is an absolute must.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.010
Seriously guys thanks for watching.

30:46.060 --> 30:48.160
Subscribe for more of this stuff and have a good day.

30:48.160 --> 30:48.600
Take care.

30:48.670 --> 30:49.490
Bye.

30:50.080 --> 30:50.670
Hey guys.

30:50.710 --> 30:54.680
So this video was brought to you by the Tech Academy to make sure you guys check them out.

30:54.680 --> 30:59.680
The link is in the description tab below from the Course list here the computer basics overall software

30:59.680 --> 31:03.460
development good HMO five CSSA database.

31:03.550 --> 31:07.810
And there is a lot more courses in writing courses all the time to make sure you guys give them a look

31:07.810 --> 31:10.330
once again and the link is in the description tab below.
