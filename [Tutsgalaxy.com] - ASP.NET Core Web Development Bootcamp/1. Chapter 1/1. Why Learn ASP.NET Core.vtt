Guys when you're building a Web site whether it's for yourself or your business or brand.

00:03.780 --> 00:08.040
One of the hardest things to do is actually find a domain name that is short and relevant and available

00:08.130 --> 00:12.170
thanks to tech domains finding the perfect domain is actually much easier.

00:12.180 --> 00:16.110
Programmers tech startups and brands finally have a domain of their own.

00:16.110 --> 00:22.170
This is why Intel Viacom and even the Consumer Electronics Show are now using that tax for their domain.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.290
So don't wait there's a black friday sale coming up it's the perfect time to secure your domain.

00:26.310 --> 00:31.410
Ninety five percent off you can pre-register before the 23rd of November to give you an additional 10

00:31.410 --> 00:32.890
percent off on top of that.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.500
You just have to go to the BW go tech forward slash Chris Hawkes that's go tech forward slash my name

00:40.500 --> 00:43.150
Chris Hong's and you can pre-register now.

00:44.080 --> 00:44.700
Hey guys what's up.

00:44.710 --> 00:50.500
So in this video I'm talking about the reasons why you want to learn dot net dot net specifically so

00:51.370 --> 00:56.920
it can be confusing especially to people that are non-Microsoft people dot net core is the newest framework

00:56.920 --> 00:57.860
from Microsoft.

00:57.860 --> 01:02.410
It's been around for about you know I guess five years or so now but it's Microsoft's newest attempt

01:02.410 --> 01:07.360
to go cross-platform so that is a new type of Microsoft Microsoft is always like you know make their

01:07.360 --> 01:13.180
bread and butter on selling Windows licenses and Microsoft licenses for different software and things

01:13.180 --> 01:13.570
like that.

01:13.570 --> 01:20.380
So in the past few years though they've actually transitioned to be more like you know Google where

01:20.380 --> 01:25.900
they're involved in it like open source projects and they've open sourced a lot of their content and

01:25.930 --> 01:30.350
their visual studio code editor that everybody is using and it's really awesome.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.790
You know what you see in front of me right here is the visual studio editor here.

01:35.840 --> 01:43.040
This is not a visual studio code but this is one of the industry leading software development environments

01:43.240 --> 01:44.430
that corporations.

01:44.430 --> 01:50.960
So if you're able to run off of a Windows machine because you know unfortunately Visual Studio itself

01:50.960 --> 01:56.480
is not fully cross-platform yet I don't believe you I'm correct I'm just trying to make sure nothing

01:56.480 --> 02:04.260
new groundbreaking has come out but Visual Studio itself only runs on Windows and Visual Studio code.

02:04.430 --> 02:11.270
You can still have a completely similar environment not it not as good but a very similar environment

02:11.390 --> 02:14.840
that can still run on Mac and Linux.

02:15.150 --> 02:20.960
So another reason why you want to learn dotnet core is Microsoft invest heavily in it and in the previous

02:20.960 --> 02:24.770
version of dot net you can see it was actually released 16 years ago.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.110
That's a long time.

02:26.510 --> 02:31.210
So there have been dotnet developers in this industry for 16 years so you can pretty much bet that dot

02:31.280 --> 02:33.670
core is going to be around for the next 16 years as well.

02:33.670 --> 02:38.180
So if you're a new developer jumping into something new like that you know four or five years from now

02:38.210 --> 02:42.920
even if you couldn't land a job for four or five years if you're writing dotnet core every single day

02:42.920 --> 02:49.040
like I just think it's impossible that you wouldn't be able to find your foot in the industry like if

02:49.040 --> 02:52.330
you just simply focused on something emerging.

02:52.370 --> 02:53.710
That's my opinion anyway.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.550
I could be wrong.

02:55.740 --> 02:59.670
So there's nothing stopping anybody from actually getting started with Dot Net or whether you're on

02:59.670 --> 03:03.300
Mac Windows or Linux Sheezus you have to download the documentation's online.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.050
It's pretty pretty good.

03:05.070 --> 03:10.590
There's also a course that I have available and then this horse here is going to start from just like.

03:10.690 --> 03:16.250
Basically I'll show you how to set up static web servers with cash for a web server which is a cross-platform

03:16.250 --> 03:21.260
dotnet core web server so if you're just interested in doing it like a static web site I'll get you

03:21.260 --> 03:25.190
up or running quickly with something like that on this tutorial series.

03:25.190 --> 03:32.450
Beyond that there's going to be more concepts of you know populating views and MVC and and you know

03:32.450 --> 03:34.230
the web API and things like that.

03:34.550 --> 03:39.350
In addition to that I'll teach you some of the more modern concepts although I don't like delve too

03:39.350 --> 03:44.210
deeply into that I'm going to build Branch I'm going to branch off courses for a different deep conversations

03:44.210 --> 03:51.020
like inversion of control but I do actually focus on explaining that he can have good unit testing and

03:51.020 --> 03:53.200
things like that is really important.

03:53.210 --> 03:57.200
Dotnet core reason another reason why you want to learn is that an X or three is coming out in early

03:57.200 --> 04:01.560
20:19 and it's going to be really big is there going to be a lot of changes.

04:01.580 --> 04:06.370
There's a lot of performance improvements and already gotten that core one which is the latest version

04:06.740 --> 04:15.410
and the one that I base this course off of is is extremely performant over the previous Dot Net Framework.

04:15.410 --> 04:20.530
The awesome thing about dotnet court 3 though is it's actually going to bring back S'pore so you could

04:20.530 --> 04:25.630
actually build these and when forms out applications like using like WPA and things like that and XML

04:26.030 --> 04:30.570
and you can build software applications that are cross-platform.

04:30.830 --> 04:34.340
Where are you going to do stuff like that that worked only on Windows.

04:34.340 --> 04:38.660
This is actually going to work and and Mac and Linux as well.

04:39.660 --> 04:46.560
So yes my tutorial uses visual studio community 20:17 which is a great product and it only works on

04:46.560 --> 04:49.560
Windows you if you're on Mac or Linux if you like why I'm not able to do that.

04:49.560 --> 04:54.630
Well you can number one set up your C-Sharp environments to work with Visual Studio code.

04:54.780 --> 05:02.190
If you wanted to do that through extension methods here by looking for C Sharp and you can set up your

05:02.190 --> 05:07.320
environment here to use dot net core and stuff like that and even debug Similarly I don't actually do

05:07.320 --> 05:08.090
that myself.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.600
I'm using Visual Studio.

05:09.600 --> 05:15.830
Another option though if you're on Mac or Linux is to just download a virtual machine so you can use

05:15.830 --> 05:20.630
something like Virtual Box which is free and you can fire up virtual machines that you could have windows

05:20.960 --> 05:26.240
simulated environments enough to just at least install the idea and started developing with C-Sharp

05:26.240 --> 05:31.150
and dynamic or on Windows if you wanted to him.

05:31.250 --> 05:35.570
Here you can see I have virtual box installed and I have it like in a buntu system that is currently

05:35.570 --> 05:36.110
powered off.

05:36.120 --> 05:41.240
But if I want to simulate in a bunch environment I just go out and fire that up and I work out of my

05:41.510 --> 05:50.830
console here and then if I need to actually like S-sh into my my Windows Server which is also a Linux

05:50.830 --> 05:56.320
system where all my web sites are hosted in everything I just use Poddy and just like I said S-sh tunnelled

05:56.320 --> 05:58.870
right into the server.

05:58.960 --> 06:04.510
So whether your Mac Windows or Linux I guess my point is that like you can there's tools out there to

06:04.510 --> 06:10.150
basically be able to work with all the environments or at least simulate replicate it you know it's

06:10.150 --> 06:15.380
you it's easier just to work with a native machine like you know for Windows or Apple development.

06:15.400 --> 06:22.150
I've been so close to just buying a Mac book so you know I can at least just get that real feel of Apple

06:22.150 --> 06:25.660
development because I've never actually program with an Apple computer.

06:25.720 --> 06:30.660
But I'm not sure like I've never been an Apple guy I've always been a PC guy ever since I was a kid

06:30.670 --> 06:35.210
so you know I will you know play with it I consider it more of a toy.

06:35.260 --> 06:42.310
But you know my point is I guess is like they're expensive and if you have a machine you just go and

06:42.310 --> 06:45.070
use these virtual machines Darger things like that you know.
