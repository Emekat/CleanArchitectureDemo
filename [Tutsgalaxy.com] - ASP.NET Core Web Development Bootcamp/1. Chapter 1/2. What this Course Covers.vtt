Hey guys what's up so in this video I just want to show you real quick.

00:03.610 --> 00:08.060
I'm a new course created just in case anybody is interested in trying to get started with that core

00:08.080 --> 00:09.510
2.1.

00:09.580 --> 00:15.940
The Course covers everything from NBC middleware creating static web sites and version of control unit

00:15.940 --> 00:18.180
testing dependency injection.

00:18.190 --> 00:19.570
I cover all of those concepts.

00:19.570 --> 00:25.930
In addition you're going to be using modern C as things like Google's material library.

00:25.970 --> 00:30.300
It also covers the latest tools and package managers like you get.

00:30.320 --> 00:34.440
So if you guys are interested in signing up I have a discounted link and the description tab below and

00:34.620 --> 00:37.610
there's over 22 modules available and the course is complete now.

00:37.610 --> 00:39.540
But I'll be adding more in the future.
