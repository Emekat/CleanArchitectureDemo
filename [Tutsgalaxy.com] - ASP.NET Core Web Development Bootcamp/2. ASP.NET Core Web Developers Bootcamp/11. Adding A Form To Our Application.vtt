WEBVTT

00:01.190 --> 00:05.150
So in this video what I want to do is actually just go out and we're going to create a few classes that

00:05.150 --> 00:06.270
I want to add.

00:06.290 --> 00:10.580
I'm going out a new class here that's going to be more in line with what our theme is for this Web site

00:10.580 --> 00:11.800
which is more of a music website.

00:11.810 --> 00:17.990
So we're going to have a band that's yes file and bands are also going to have similar to what we had

00:17.990 --> 00:22.160
in the book we're going to have both of the title

00:27.820 --> 00:32.930
as well the title and genre

00:39.140 --> 00:47.380
origin and then we'll just have the biography.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.710
So just those four key elements on the band.

00:52.770 --> 00:53.030
All right.

00:53.030 --> 01:00.050
And and now that we have that let's go to the music controller and the music is instead of returning

01:00.050 --> 01:03.500
a list of books it's going on return a list of bands.

01:03.770 --> 01:07.490
And now the band is going to be called Bass.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.630
This is going to be a new band

01:14.260 --> 01:16.680
voyage and you lose

01:25.290 --> 01:31.240
genre.

01:32.550 --> 01:39.360
And then finally one biography around as well say blah blah blah.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.890
All right so there we go.

01:40.900 --> 01:45.690
So we have one band and now it's going to add a few more bands just because we feel like we need to

01:45.690 --> 01:48.990
have a new band brand new band and

01:52.920 --> 01:55.830
you can put whatever you want in here obviously.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.250
At least we have three snow.

02:12.250 --> 02:17.680
Another thing to is I want to move my list out of this scope from just this and next month that I want

02:17.680 --> 02:22.570
to have it publicly available and available to the class which means I have to declare what type it

02:22.570 --> 02:22.950
is.

02:22.960 --> 02:28.920
It's a list of band and we probably have a better name for that.

02:29.130 --> 02:30.630
All right so there we go.

02:36.230 --> 02:39.800
All right and then finally what I want to do is go ahead and add a another page which we're going to

02:39.800 --> 02:45.080
have actual result and this is going to be called Ad so this is we're going to add a new band to our

02:45.080 --> 02:47.860
page so we're going to be adding a new band.

02:48.050 --> 02:53.800
In this case we're not going to be posting anything so we'll see in just a moment.

02:53.810 --> 02:57.560
This is just going to go ahead and create a new VM model.

02:57.560 --> 03:06.590
So it is a variable view model equals new band and then we're going to pass that view model down to

03:06.590 --> 03:15.210
the viewers who will say return this stuff view pass in the band and know the Wiimote on Sir

03:18.490 --> 03:19.500
why are you doing that to me.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.460
All right.

03:22.670 --> 03:27.990
So now this ad is complaining and says doesn't return value because blah blah blah.

03:29.830 --> 03:33.540
And that's because you're not returning this obviously and they return this view and now it's going

03:33.540 --> 03:34.450
to stop complaining.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.780
But there is no views.

03:35.980 --> 03:41.800
At our view and since we're using a model we're going to be doing a create which means a form and we

03:41.800 --> 03:48.810
can go out and create a band so we can add the band model and it's going to use the lay out page and

03:48.860 --> 03:55.850
we're going to add that all right now what we also need to do is we need to update our layout page because

03:55.850 --> 03:57.890
right now the layout page has way too much stuff in it.

03:57.890 --> 04:04.140
So if we go over to the layout page you're going to see all this this content up here.

04:04.450 --> 04:06.770
All these call outs and stuff like that like.

04:06.800 --> 04:12.380
So basically we probably want the header and most of the pages like this about the services all of us

04:13.270 --> 04:19.370
all know it all as young as about governing to get rid of all of that right now.

04:19.870 --> 04:25.620
And we're going to put that inside of the home.

04:25.790 --> 04:32.480
So instead of this we're going to put this inside of the home and that should be rendered only on the

04:32.480 --> 04:36.760
home page then and the Shared Page is going to have much less stuff in there.

04:36.770 --> 04:45.620
But I think this body should still probably be inside of a section and based on the CSSA of this bootstrap

04:45.620 --> 04:47.260
theme that we're using.

04:47.930 --> 04:53.680
All right so we have that instead of a section it looks like we have a pretty cleaned up application

04:53.680 --> 04:56.060
that was getting press play and run this thing

05:01.900 --> 05:08.480
so we're going navigate over to Home and X. And then you can see that we get the full thing like we

05:08.480 --> 05:16.220
had with our lab of four that's fine now but if we go to music and we go to the index we're still not

05:16.680 --> 05:19.450
it's still it's complete you mother.

05:19.610 --> 05:25.070
That's right because we didn't update the the template so if we go over to the temple we update the

05:25.070 --> 05:33.740
template for this music index file because if you remember correctly this is a list of bands so we're

05:33.740 --> 05:36.350
going to say this create new.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.200
We'll get into that in just a second actually.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.550
Not going to get into that right this second.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.950
This is going to say our list of bands.

05:47.980 --> 05:48.710
Right.

05:48.990 --> 05:54.430
And then we need to go up and we need to update the model to use band and book since that's what it's

05:54.430 --> 05:59.890
iterating over and it looks like this is all good and we don't want the author the title we want the

06:01.600 --> 06:03.390
genre probably next.

06:03.400 --> 06:09.640
And then since we're in a table we'll just continue that for right now.

06:11.730 --> 06:19.650
And we have the genre and then the origin and then the biography.

06:19.860 --> 06:24.810
I suppose that those those four elements of our band and in here obviously we have a problem as well.

06:24.960 --> 06:34.150
You would just say origin but we also need to shoot we need that to be in order.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.300
This needs to be a genre

06:41.300 --> 06:43.890
Hama and this needs to be biography.

06:43.960 --> 06:44.410
All right.

06:44.440 --> 06:48.350
So now our headers should match up to our data and we're good.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.220
All right let's stop this.

06:50.290 --> 06:51.380
Restart it.

07:01.620 --> 07:06.280
And if you are over there we now have the layout being found and all that stuff and then inside this

07:06.500 --> 07:09.210
this data we now have.

07:09.350 --> 07:14.240
So let's go navigate over to the ad and we can see this.

07:14.330 --> 07:19.790
They created this form for us in the scaffolding meaning they had gotten an application using Visual

07:19.790 --> 07:20.240
Studio.

07:20.240 --> 07:25.400
So what I want to do is replace this section render body right here and I'm gonna replace it with just

07:25.400 --> 07:26.030
a container.

07:26.030 --> 07:31.310
So I wanted to bootstrap container to do the render body you shouldn't have to restart the server you

07:31.310 --> 07:37.910
should be able to just you should just be able to refresh it if you do that you can see that the changes

07:37.910 --> 07:39.920
take effect right away.

07:39.990 --> 07:43.990
And here we have some information that is it's really lacking here.

07:44.060 --> 07:48.150
It's not it's not giving us any hopeful information as to what information we're filling out here it

07:48.150 --> 07:51.680
does tell us that we're adding a band I guess that's sort of helpful.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.910
One thing's for sure as well it seems like every page doesn't need this header so let's go ahead and

07:55.910 --> 07:59.420
fix that as well as the final thing that we're going to do.

07:59.420 --> 08:03.810
So let's go to the lay out and the lay out.

08:03.820 --> 08:12.440
I'm going to get rid of this this head piece right here that should probably only be on the in the home

08:12.440 --> 08:14.990
control or the I'm sorry the home page here.

08:14.990 --> 08:17.640
So let's go and add this to the top.

08:23.210 --> 08:23.990
All right there we go.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.150
And once again you should be able to take effect right away.
