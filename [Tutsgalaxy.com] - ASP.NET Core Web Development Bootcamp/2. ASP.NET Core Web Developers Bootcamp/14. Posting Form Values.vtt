Hey guys what's up.

00:01.230 --> 00:01.750
Welcome back.

00:01.750 --> 00:05.760
So in this video I want to show you how to post values up from your forum.

00:05.760 --> 00:10.230
There's also a built in Razor form helper that's going to be able to help you out here because normally

00:10.230 --> 00:13.330
you have to spell out exactly where you want this thing to post to.

00:13.620 --> 00:17.170
But what I want to do is go out and just remove this validation from our form.

00:17.190 --> 00:21.060
Make makes you just pause the video right here and just make sure you have the same thing from the previous

00:21.060 --> 00:21.940
video.

00:22.110 --> 00:27.180
And if you don't just make sure you're going to be getting rid of this part but here I want to go and

00:27.180 --> 00:28.240
use the helper.

00:28.290 --> 00:35.830
I'm going to say using and then we're going to say age now and then inside of here we're going to say

00:37.350 --> 00:43.950
I'm sorry we're going to say using and then inside of parentheses aged female Eldad begin form and then

00:43.980 --> 00:49.120
inside of here the first thing we do is we give it the name of the method that we want to hit or the

00:49.740 --> 00:57.600
function that is on the controller class and then the second thing is we want to give it the name of

00:57.600 --> 01:00.180
the controller itself which is music.

01:00.240 --> 01:00.480
All right.

01:00.480 --> 01:06.300
So after these two parentheses you want to have the curly braces and you want all the form elements

01:06.780 --> 01:09.690
to be inside the curly braces.

01:09.690 --> 01:17.530
And since this is a form helper using razor You don't need the closing form statement what I want to

01:17.530 --> 01:19.830
do is go over to the music controller.

01:19.830 --> 01:24.160
I have a couple of break points here I just want to have it on the try and then also on the catch in

01:24.160 --> 01:25.890
case there is a problem.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.410
But this was a point that was created for us by default.

01:29.410 --> 01:36.640
So you're going to notice that we have these HDTV post attributes that's the way the MVC application

01:36.640 --> 01:38.070
is able to tell the difference between.

01:38.100 --> 01:44.190
OK you want the pre-formed page or Oh you're posting the values from the create form page.

01:44.190 --> 01:51.200
So that's why the post is going to signify the difference between the two revalidate and the forgery

01:51.430 --> 01:54.890
token is actually something that is involved in cross-site scripting.

01:54.890 --> 01:57.690
It's an actual It's a common hacking attack.

01:58.090 --> 02:02.170
You guys can look it up it's beyond the scope of this tutorial but it's cross-site scripting.

02:02.170 --> 02:07.330
But this is to prevent that by default and visi has protections in place to try to protect you from

02:07.330 --> 02:09.010
making mistakes.

02:09.910 --> 02:14.650
So it and fire up the application and navigate over to our create page.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.040
And here we go.

02:16.040 --> 02:25.540
Let's go ahead and give us some names of some stuff put in Chris Turner country USA and like me I'm

02:25.540 --> 02:28.820
just kind of this is like so pompous and arrogant.

02:28.840 --> 02:29.950
I'm actually not like that.

02:30.020 --> 02:32.210
So biography.

02:32.230 --> 02:38.030
I'm from Virginia.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.850
All right so now what we're going to do is we are going to get a problem because what this thing did

02:41.850 --> 02:44.080
is it redirected to the music site.

02:44.460 --> 02:48.210
And unfortunately this did not work at all one second so.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.650
So the code is fine just make sure you restart your server.

02:50.650 --> 02:55.920
And I'm not really sure if this is something to do with my local setup or not but the caching thing

02:55.920 --> 02:56.610
really sucks.

02:56.610 --> 03:00.600
But if you guys want to put some values in here and then we click Create.

03:00.600 --> 03:04.920
Now this is going to go out and hit the point so if we look over the collection value you can see that

03:04.920 --> 03:11.350
there are a few keys inside of your that title genre origin and biography things like that.

03:11.910 --> 03:18.000
And if we wanted to see the actual results of those values we could actually just hover over the collection

03:18.060 --> 03:19.610
and then go to the results view.

03:19.620 --> 03:26.430
And then you can see down in here you can see that the title passen is 80 genre's ATF ATF radio for

03:26.430 --> 03:26.810
all of them.

03:26.830 --> 03:33.870
But you can see there and then there's also this request verification to concerts this humongous base

03:33.870 --> 03:36.220
64 encrypted token.

03:36.630 --> 03:40.970
So you can see why the page actually errs out because it actually hits the redirect to action right

03:40.970 --> 03:45.750
here and then it just bounces right over to the main page and it tries to for each.

03:45.750 --> 03:51.630
Over a model of band values that doesn't exist.

03:51.680 --> 03:56.550
So just for craps and gigs Let's go ahead and just return the view as well.

03:56.550 --> 03:59.590
From this view as well so that way you know to stop the server.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.790
But that way it will not air out every time.

04:02.790 --> 04:09.700
Right now now normally in your tristate here this is where you're going to end up validating server

04:09.700 --> 04:13.180
side the values that are passed end and we'll see how to do that in a moment.

04:13.210 --> 04:18.700
And then there's also the fact you this is where you would store you know or call either some sort of

04:18.700 --> 04:24.070
third party service or something to pass values in or to get values based on the values you have.

04:24.070 --> 04:29.490
But obviously the sky's limit there and then catches where everything blows up and your servers on fire.
