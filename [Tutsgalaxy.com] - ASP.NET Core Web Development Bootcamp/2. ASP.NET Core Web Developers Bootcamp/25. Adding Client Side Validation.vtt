Hey guys.

00:01.080 --> 00:01.610
So welcome back.

00:01.610 --> 00:04.480
So in this video we want to do is look at validation.

00:04.790 --> 00:10.730
We had a create form page that was collecting some information for the band and if you remember we put

00:10.730 --> 00:13.420
in this validation message for and I didn't really cover that too much.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.620
But in this video that's what I want to cover.

00:16.040 --> 00:20.870
So the preferred method with dot net core is actually still to use Jake worry and Jake worry for its

00:21.110 --> 00:22.250
validation.

00:22.580 --> 00:25.870
And it really does help you a lot and you'll see here in the video.

00:25.890 --> 00:29.000
But a lot of people are turned off from Jay Querrey and they don't want to use and you don't really

00:29.000 --> 00:32.360
have to be then you're going to be custom rolling your own validation.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.120
I'm sure there's validation of libraries out there.

00:34.130 --> 00:40.910
But let me just show you how easy it is to actually use a query and invalidate the way most most every

00:40.910 --> 00:43.580
place I've ever seen that uses done that does it.

00:43.580 --> 00:46.250
So let's use the required attribute.

00:46.280 --> 00:51.500
And this required actually we can give a custom error message and to it so we can say error message

00:51.530 --> 00:55.570
equals and we can just say what does this field say.

00:55.610 --> 01:03.660
John Roberts so say genre is required or something like that.

01:03.710 --> 01:09.200
So now that we've added this attribute is called a data annotation and automatically because we've set

01:09.200 --> 01:13.640
up our create page to have this validation message for for the genre.

01:14.030 --> 01:18.590
If we enable clients validation by including just a couple of scripts so we need to our layout page

01:19.310 --> 01:22.700
we can go ahead and get clients validation without having to do any work.

01:22.700 --> 01:30.790
So if you paste then there is a CDN that I want to point to and the client side scripts right here.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.350
If you just pause a screen or these to validate where you validate libraries that we need.

01:36.650 --> 01:41.330
So now that we have those client scripts enabled if we go to try to submit our page the client validation

01:41.330 --> 01:43.010
is automatically going to kick in.

01:43.010 --> 01:47.120
It's going to look at that required attribute and it's going to see that there's no value in the genre

01:47.120 --> 01:47.850
field here.

01:47.960 --> 01:53.120
You can see like I know the you guys all MSW can see we can have a value here and if there's no value

01:53.240 --> 01:55.310
it's going to go and throw an error message.

01:55.310 --> 01:58.730
So you can say automatically genre is required it didn't even try to hit the server.

01:58.730 --> 02:00.920
So all that code is set up for you right there.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.600
Now normally you would want like you know some sort of style on.

02:04.670 --> 02:11.900
So like you would end up having like the genre error really you could just have a general error message

02:11.900 --> 02:14.720
probably error class that you can assign.

02:14.730 --> 02:18.400
You'll see in a moment I can actually show you how to assign a class to this.

02:19.190 --> 02:24.710
But if you do this like normally you would want to have like a color red because that's more of a that's

02:24.710 --> 02:26.400
more in line with an error message.

02:26.540 --> 02:31.370
But we'll actually see in the future videos actually how we apply custom attributes because that's actually

02:31.370 --> 02:33.740
a completely separate video.

02:33.740 --> 02:38.140
Now there's all kinds of other data annotations that we can use for validation.

02:38.570 --> 02:39.340
Tons of freedom there.

02:39.340 --> 02:41.580
So let's go out and look at a few of them.

02:42.490 --> 02:45.500
The regular expression validation is something you're going to see a lot.

02:45.540 --> 02:53.430
I'm going to do that right now and to do that you just simply say regular expression and then the first

02:53.430 --> 02:56.730
arguments are what you should do a string escape string.

02:56.730 --> 03:03.240
So that way it's basically a rostering format and then you're going to use whatever sort of you know

03:04.820 --> 03:07.600
yeah whatever sort of validation you want.

03:07.600 --> 03:14.110
So in this case this is a regular expression that says that there must be like some sort of you know

03:14.210 --> 03:19.790
number what you like it's funny like why is it like Delia what does that stand for.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.620
But anyway for what I guess it does it or something.

03:21.620 --> 03:24.900
But anyway I think for whatever reason that is the regular expression for the number.

03:24.900 --> 03:29.250
So this will say like so basically if there's not a number in the origin and you're going to throw an

03:29.250 --> 03:30.080
error message.

03:30.210 --> 03:36.620
And again you have the option of saying what that error message is you can pass it in and say you stupid

03:39.790 --> 03:40.350
mother.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.530
I mean just kidding.

03:41.650 --> 03:45.900
So let's just keep it at that one.

03:46.030 --> 03:49.860
And when we go ahead and try to validate this let's go and see if it works.

03:49.900 --> 03:54.550
So once again hopefully you guys have the watch Make sure you guys watch my video about how to set up

03:54.550 --> 03:58.250
a watch because it's so much easier than having to restart your server all the time.

03:59.180 --> 04:04.670
So if we go back over to the web page now I'm just going to zoom really far in on the origin and we

04:04.670 --> 04:05.840
didn't make it required by the way.

04:05.840 --> 04:10.000
So if you try to go ahead and submit it it's probably only going to fire for the genre obviously because

04:10.000 --> 04:12.310
I was the only one that we said it was required.

04:12.440 --> 04:17.510
But once you go it and put something in the origin field list and put it so about I should put some

04:17.510 --> 04:18.440
CSSA on this.

04:18.440 --> 04:24.340
But anyway once you put a value in here a regular expression said actually one number.

04:24.350 --> 04:27.410
So you can't have two because then it's going to fire the validation.

04:27.570 --> 04:34.740
If you have one number validation goes away that's how you use the regular expression validator regular

04:34.740 --> 04:36.410
expressions are like there isn't.

04:36.420 --> 04:40.620
There's entire books written on the subject that is it's something I've been using for like eight years

04:40.650 --> 04:43.110
but it is very very cryptic.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.400
You can never really read them like you can write them pretty well but then you never really know how

04:46.400 --> 04:48.570
to read them if they're really really complex.

04:48.930 --> 04:53.430
I mean you just kind of have to rely on some but some are like literally like almost like pages long

04:53.430 --> 04:58.350
and people just assume that they work because nobody has time to actually break down what the hell they're

04:58.350 --> 04:59.370
actually doing.
