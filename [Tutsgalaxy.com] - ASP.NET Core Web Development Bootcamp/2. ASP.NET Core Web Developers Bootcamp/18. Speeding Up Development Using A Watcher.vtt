00:00.720 --> 00:04.950
So what I want to show you guys in this module here is that you can actually make your development a

00:04.950 --> 00:10.800
lot easier with dotnet core and I dot net with this new dot net watch command which is very similar

00:10.800 --> 00:11.520
to the Web pack.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.430
Watch if you guys have ever used that before.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.150
But it listens for any sort of file changes that are being made.

00:17.340 --> 00:21.390
And that way you can go ahead and you just have to run it one time and as you're making changes to the

00:21.390 --> 00:23.480
server code you don't want to restart the application.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.530
It's going to go on restart for you.

00:26.550 --> 00:33.390
So in order for this to actually work you need to go to your NEW get go to your tools and get a package

00:33.390 --> 00:40.050
manager go to the managed to get packages and here you can actually just type.

00:40.050 --> 00:42.130
Watch.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.610
So it's actually confusing because there's a few of them here in this that the watch is not actually

00:45.610 --> 00:46.280
what we want.

00:46.280 --> 00:51.070
So what I want you to do is type in watch your tools and this should actually pull up the one you want

00:51.070 --> 00:55.780
which is Microsoft on Wotcher tools and we want to go and select we're going to install it to our first

00:55.780 --> 01:00.830
application and then just go and click click install.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.390
So basically for the sake of this we'll just make it easy.

01:03.390 --> 01:07.380
But if you go to the command prompt where the project is located here and all you have to do is say

01:07.380 --> 01:09.830
Dot Net watch run.

01:10.290 --> 01:13.470
And then this will go through and it's going to start of the server for you.

01:13.470 --> 01:17.370
So instead of the browser automatically opening up for you you're going to want to go and just pull

01:17.370 --> 01:18.250
up a browser.

01:18.420 --> 01:21.300
You can see it's listening on port 5 0 0 0 0 in there.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.010
So if we go over to the localhost

01:26.490 --> 01:30.630
it's still going to run the same exact application we're going go to the local 5000 You can see that

01:30.630 --> 01:31.890
we get to this new music.

01:32.160 --> 01:40.810
And if we go over to our music details one here you can see the name of the band we're getting.

01:40.830 --> 01:45.330
I know it's very hard to read here but you can see we're getting the name Bayside here.

01:45.330 --> 01:51.270
Now this is coming from the server so normally if I wanted to change that data I'd have to restart the

01:51.270 --> 01:52.160
server.

01:52.260 --> 01:56.460
And if we look at the controller where the data is coming from it's hard coded right into the controller

01:56.490 --> 01:57.780
and passed down to the viewer.

01:57.780 --> 02:03.030
So if I want to change this again normally we would have to restart the server but all I did was press

02:03.030 --> 02:04.030
control.

02:06.320 --> 02:11.390
And if we actually look at the code you can actually see that it didn't watch and it made a change here

02:11.400 --> 02:12.510
to our application.

02:13.300 --> 02:17.080
So without having to restart the server if I just refresh the page you're going to see that you have

02:17.170 --> 02:22.960
the actual changes so it's much easier to go ahead and debug with this tool or just you know develop

02:22.960 --> 02:24.830
with this tool saves a lot of time.
