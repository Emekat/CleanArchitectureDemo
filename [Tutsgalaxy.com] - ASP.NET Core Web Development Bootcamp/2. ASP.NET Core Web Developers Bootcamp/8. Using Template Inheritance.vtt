Hey guys welcome back.

00:01.570 --> 00:07.050
So in this video what we want to look at is the layout page and the reason on the layout page is beneficials

00:07.050 --> 00:11.130
because then we can reuse a lot of our code so we don't have to redefine all this code that's in the

00:11.130 --> 00:12.310
head.

00:12.790 --> 00:18.180
And you know the closing body aged him and things like that so we're going to do is use a layout page

00:18.240 --> 00:22.620
and that's going to have all the common code inside of it and then we're going to have pages that will

00:22.620 --> 00:29.440
derive and use that layout page to just inject you know pieces into certain areas of the layout.

00:29.510 --> 00:31.770
So let's go out and look into how we're going to do that.

00:33.830 --> 00:38.960
So by convention there's usually a shared folder inside of the views folder that we're going to go out

00:38.960 --> 00:39.400
and create.

00:39.400 --> 00:45.590
Right now we're going to call this shared and then inside of the shared Let's go out and say and new

00:45.590 --> 00:52.390
item and go to the Web and we're going to select raise or lay out and just go out and have the default

00:52.390 --> 00:55.420
layout underscore layout that's fine.

00:55.420 --> 01:01.060
So now that we've added it we have this layout and you can see that there's this rendered body so that's

01:01.070 --> 01:07.100
how do we go ahead and we get our home page to use that layout page.

01:07.110 --> 01:13.410
So in order to use the layout page you can see if we go to our normal home index page that the layout

01:13.410 --> 01:18.270
is no so it's just a string that it's expecting if you hover over it you can see that it's expecting

01:18.270 --> 01:19.410
a string.

01:19.440 --> 01:24.630
So we just just had to give it the string which is the location of where it can be found in the project.

01:24.630 --> 01:28.180
We're going to use the Tildy here so that that is the root directory.

01:28.290 --> 01:30.700
Look inside the views inside the shed.

01:31.020 --> 01:38.520
And then the name of our layout file which is layouts DSHEA HTML and that should be that.

01:38.560 --> 01:38.790
All right.

01:38.800 --> 01:44.500
So that's our string and now that we're using that if it doesn't find it a visual studio doesn't find

01:44.500 --> 01:50.620
it you should end up getting an error message there but now that we have this layout page we don't have

01:50.620 --> 01:52.690
to have all of this.

01:52.840 --> 02:02.770
Tim L stuff this content right here is going to be injected into the body of the layout page by default

02:02.780 --> 02:03.980
this rendered body right here.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.750
So let's go out and run it and take a look.

02:07.570 --> 02:09.630
So pulling it up in the browser there it is.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.580
You can see Chris is great and it's the same exact.
