Hey guys what a welcome back.

00:01.950 --> 00:05.880
So in this video we're going to be doing is adding a new page to our application.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.580
I want to show you how easy it is to use the scaffolding within Visual Studio So if we stop our server

00:10.590 --> 00:17.160
make sure it's not running right click on controllers and we're going to say add and from here if we

00:17.160 --> 00:23.520
just say add controller we can select an NBC controller and just say and this is where we're going to

00:23.520 --> 00:24.210
give it a name.

00:24.210 --> 00:32.690
Someone called it a music controller and click ADD.

00:32.730 --> 00:37.740
So you'll notice that it's actually it has an index method built for us by the fall.

00:37.740 --> 00:43.260
But if we look at the view there is no view created for us so if we want to create a view if you right

00:43.260 --> 00:45.730
click on view you can just say add view.

00:46.050 --> 00:51.450
And then here we can use the benefit of saying you know what this one is going to have a model I want

00:51.450 --> 01:02.370
to use a model so it's going to be a list model and the list is going to be we have the name book.

01:03.030 --> 01:07.700
Yeah that's that's the only model we have right now.

01:07.710 --> 01:09.620
But let's go out and we'll just use book for right now.

01:09.640 --> 01:10.240
That's right.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.490
And this is where we can say we want to use our layout page and you can go ahead and go under your views

01:14.490 --> 01:22.830
and go to share click your layout page and say ADD and now we'll have an entirely new section of the

01:22.830 --> 01:23.350
Web site.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.500
So if we want to navigate to it instead of saying home we're going to say music so we run the application

01:33.540 --> 01:45.490
and we go over here and where we used to say Home Index we're now going to say music and X and here

01:45.490 --> 01:47.020
what you're going to see is an exception.

01:47.030 --> 01:53.620
And by default Espey dot net is going to have your debugging session information available to you like

01:53.620 --> 01:57.640
you would never want this information available to the public because then a hacker would be able to

01:57.640 --> 01:58.720
exploit you.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.060
But this is something you do want to have in front of you whenever you need to debug.

02:03.310 --> 02:07.750
So it tells you right here what the problem is when we use the scaffolding and we said that we wanted

02:07.780 --> 02:09.310
to list out items.

02:09.310 --> 02:13.370
It was assuming that we were going to be sending down a list of data that we never did.

02:13.390 --> 02:17.350
In fact it was assuming a list of books and we never did.

02:17.350 --> 02:21.000
So you can see it for each statement inside of this template.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.900
So if we look inside the index see SHC Millward this is being thrown.

02:25.900 --> 02:30.490
You'll see that is there for each statement right here and this is where it's blowing up because inside

02:30.490 --> 02:33.790
of the model it's expecting a list of values and there's not.

02:33.790 --> 02:41.640
So in order to fix that we'd have to go to the controller and we've got the music controller and clearly

02:41.640 --> 02:45.030
here we need to be passing down a list of book value.

02:45.030 --> 02:56.250
So we'll just save our my list equals new list of books and we'll just instantiate one new book on your

02:56.250 --> 02:57.250
blog.

02:58.020 --> 03:01.530
And here let's go and click on this and this is where we're going to use intellisense.

03:01.530 --> 03:06.260
You click on the light bulb and then you can go out and it will recommend for you what to do.

03:06.270 --> 03:11.390
Or you can do this you can have it selected in press control dot and it'll do the same thing.

03:11.380 --> 03:15.990
It'll pull up and then Intellisense and you click on that it will add the using statement and everything's

03:15.990 --> 03:16.320
fine.

03:16.320 --> 03:21.400
So now you get the intellisense that you want like the title equals.

03:22.110 --> 03:28.800
You know we're going to have like a movie title whenever an author calls mail gifts and now we're getting

03:28.800 --> 03:29.560
all confused.

03:29.580 --> 03:34.470
We have music books and movies.

03:34.470 --> 03:34.740
All right.

03:34.740 --> 03:40.500
So now that we've done this we're going to go to return our list so we're going to return my list to

03:40.500 --> 03:42.770
the template if we run the application again.

03:42.780 --> 03:48.780
We should actually be OK we're only going to one list or one item listed out but it's still it's not

03:48.780 --> 03:54.280
going to blow up because the for each statement will at least have something to work with.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.180
So we're going to music and it's all right and there you go.

03:58.470 --> 04:02.520
So inside of our thing you can see that we just create new that should be like a link or a button or

04:02.520 --> 04:07.080
something like that but here is our title and then you can go and you can edit these values.
