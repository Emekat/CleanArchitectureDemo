So what I want to show you in this video is if you notice if we went to our root directory where we

00:04.230 --> 00:07.680
installed the saw this parallax template everything works right.

00:07.690 --> 00:12.630
And we have all our CSSA But what happens if we go to the details page and we go to our music details

00:12.630 --> 00:16.480
page and you look at this and we have no CSSA no images everything's missing.

00:16.590 --> 00:20.400
Even though it's using the layout page you can see it's using the layout because of the navigation bar

00:20.400 --> 00:21.050
and everything.

00:21.240 --> 00:25.850
So why is it if we inspect the console you're going to see anytime you have weirdness like this you

00:25.860 --> 00:28.890
want to look at the console and see all these four or four is not found.

00:28.890 --> 00:32.770
So it's not finding materialized or all these external resources.

00:32.790 --> 00:39.870
And the reason why is because of this exact relative address here so there is a shortcut though that

00:39.870 --> 00:43.380
we can use to solve this problem.

00:43.620 --> 00:48.190
And we do that by simply referencing the root directory of the project by using the Tildy character.

00:48.180 --> 00:53.550
So if you use this tool the character is going to grab the root directory and then the forward slash

00:53.560 --> 00:55.080
So it's always going to work.

00:55.110 --> 01:00.980
So go ahead and update all your references so that they have this Tilda's forward slash.

01:01.050 --> 01:07.740
So if we do that and we now go back over to the music directory or page you can now see that we're getting

01:07.740 --> 01:14.660
the C S S and everything and we expect our console and we shouldn't be getting any more 404 error messages.
