Hey guys what's up.

00:01.150 --> 00:05.830
So welcome to this new esprit de corps tutorial series and we're going to be using the latest version

00:05.830 --> 00:09.980
of dot net core which as of the time in this video is 2.1.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.650
And in order to be able to proceed with this tutorial you definitely need to make sure that you download

00:14.650 --> 00:16.490
that and have it installed.

00:16.630 --> 00:20.290
And if you're on Windows you might as well have the Dot Net framework there as well in case you guys

00:20.290 --> 00:24.690
decide to not use that code for whatever sort of project you're using.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.860
The tutorial.

00:26.050 --> 00:31.830
We're going to be covering here is going to apply to both dot net core as well as the Dot Net Framework.

00:31.830 --> 00:38.110
The latest version is there are going to be certain features of each one that may not be 100 percent

00:38.110 --> 00:45.520
compatible but ultimately most of the material that will cover is going to be it's going to work on

00:45.520 --> 00:46.750
both versions.

00:48.800 --> 00:54.830
So specifically what we're going to be looking at is the Dot Net runtime is Microsoft's runtime that

00:54.830 --> 01:02.060
runs on its operating system so the Dot Net Framework runs on a Microsoft operating system not their

01:02.060 --> 01:08.860
core is a is actually able to be run cross-platform so it's not just for Microsoft operating systems

01:08.870 --> 01:12.410
it can also be used for Mac and Linux.

01:12.420 --> 01:19.620
So in addition to that there is a language which is C-Sharp and that's the language we're going to be

01:19.620 --> 01:24.900
focusing on in this tutorial and that is Microsoft's flagship language that they've used for the last

01:24.900 --> 01:33.360
probably 15 probably 18 years now I guess and that is a language that was much inspired by the Java

01:33.420 --> 01:37.530
language it's a fully object oriented language and we're going to be looking at that in this tutorial

01:37.530 --> 01:45.300
series and then specifically for the C-sharp language there is the airspeeds net web framework which

01:45.300 --> 01:52.670
is Microsoft's most popular web framework and the latest version is HSP dotnet core.

01:52.950 --> 01:58.500
So I've been writing C-Sharp and specifically Espina Net Web sites for roughly eight years or so on

01:58.500 --> 01:59.580
and off.

01:59.730 --> 02:02.420
I do a lot of javascript in front of you I work.

02:02.580 --> 02:08.970
But as you'll see and hear HSP dot net consists of a lot of C-Sharp code.

02:08.970 --> 02:14.520
Now you can use Visual Basic or VB dot net if you wanted to but most people that are doing anything

02:14.520 --> 02:18.250
with Microsoft these days are going to be using C-Sharp for anything new.

02:18.510 --> 02:24.180
I mean that's just my recommendation that if you're going to be choosing between you know VB or C-Sharp

02:24.270 --> 02:27.490
I would definitely choose C-sharp.

02:27.560 --> 02:32.120
So the final thing that you'll need that I recommend as an editor you need some sort of development

02:32.120 --> 02:32.670
environment.

02:32.670 --> 02:37.280
Now you can use visual code Visual Studio code if you want to but this tutorial series is going to be

02:37.280 --> 02:43.100
using the free version of Visual Studio 20:17 there is a community once that you can see free download

02:43.100 --> 02:47.000
right there so I'll have both of these links and the description tab.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.940
So make sure you have both of them installed.
