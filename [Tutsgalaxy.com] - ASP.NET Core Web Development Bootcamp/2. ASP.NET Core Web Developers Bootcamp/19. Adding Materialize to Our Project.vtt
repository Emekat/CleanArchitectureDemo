All right so materialize is a modern affronting framework that is actually based on Google's material

00:06.120 --> 00:12.390
design which is very popular with things like react and it's very mobile friendly responsive everything

00:12.930 --> 00:14.650
from the components very flat look.

00:14.830 --> 00:15.960
But there's always different components.

00:15.960 --> 00:23.160
You have that just work and this is not a bootstrap based framework or anything it doesn't use bootstrap

00:23.160 --> 00:23.420
at all.

00:23.420 --> 00:28.200
So a lot of people kind of think that like all of these CSSA frameworks are somehow built off of bootstrap

00:28.200 --> 00:31.350
and that's that's not the case is a completely separate project.

00:31.340 --> 00:32.390
It's very very popular.

00:32.390 --> 00:39.940
It's built to use like SAS So if you guys you see us as preprocessors then this works very well with.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.490
So you get start using it.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.920
It's it's really just a simple as going to your layout page and you're just going to go ahead and for

00:46.920 --> 00:53.800
us to make this as easy as possible I'm going to use the CD and replace the J Querrey right here.

00:53.910 --> 00:58.770
And these are just to see ends on this content distribution network which is really just a server serving

00:58.770 --> 01:03.470
up this VSS and Javascript you need and it's you know it's free to connect.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.930
So it's just easier to set up that way.

01:05.970 --> 01:10.200
Now you also have the option of downloading the actual files and including them in your project so you

01:10.200 --> 01:12.680
don't want to reach across the web to another server.

01:12.990 --> 01:18.960
And then there's also the option of having SAS compilation to serve you of a SAS compiler then you can

01:18.960 --> 01:23.260
download the actual SAS source files and start extending it.

01:23.280 --> 01:27.960
So after you've included materialize there are templates you can use like if you go to this Web site

01:27.960 --> 01:32.580
here and you want to demo this template you can take a look at this and if you download it and just

01:32.580 --> 01:38.670
extract it to our W.W. root folder or wherever your static folder is then you can see that just as easily

01:39.300 --> 01:43.590
We have a materialized working UI here and just just quickly.
