Guys when you're building a Web site whether it's for yourself or your business or brand.

00:03.750 --> 00:08.010
One of the hardest things to do is actually find a domain name that is short and relevant and available

00:08.100 --> 00:12.150
thanks to tech domains finding the perfect domain is actually much easier.

00:12.150 --> 00:16.080
Programmers tech startups and brands finally have a domain of their own.

00:16.080 --> 00:22.260
This is why Intel Viacom and even the Consumer Electronics Show are now using techs for their domain.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.260
So don't wait there's a black friday sale coming up it's the perfect time to secure your domain.

00:26.290 --> 00:31.680
Ninety five percent off you can pre-register before the 23rd of November to get an additional 10 percent

00:31.680 --> 00:32.850
off on top of that.

00:32.970 --> 00:34.790
You just have to go to WWE.

00:34.830 --> 00:37.870
Go tech forward slash Chris hawks.

00:38.080 --> 00:38.660
Go.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.990
Tack forward slash.

00:39.990 --> 00:43.370
My name Chris hawks and you can pre-register now.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.650
Hey guys what's up on this video.

00:44.670 --> 00:50.080
I have a brand new Mac install and I want to show you guys how to get started with Natcore good in.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.160
Pull up your terminal.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.550
All right now what I want to do is go to the Web site and there's only one version they are going to

00:56.550 --> 00:57.970
download the dotnet core.

00:57.980 --> 01:00.650
2.1 is the latest version so let's go in and grab that

01:18.350 --> 01:18.750
said.

01:18.780 --> 01:20.090
We have that install that's good

01:22.930 --> 01:26.630
and will move that to the trash that's mine.

01:26.640 --> 01:32.010
So now if you restart the terminal go into these joints and we're going to zoom in so you can actually

01:32.010 --> 01:38.980
see the and if we type A dot net and we do a hyphen different version and you should get the version

01:38.980 --> 01:42.280
number of dot net that's running on your Mac machine.

01:42.280 --> 01:42.710
All right.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.040
So that's how we install it.

01:44.050 --> 01:49.210
So the next thing you're going to want to do is go and download a visual studio code which is the best

01:49.420 --> 01:52.960
cross-platform editor that we can use for running C-Sharp code.

01:55.020 --> 02:00.700
The visual studio Kotas and Stahl Let's go and open it up and we want to get our extensions here and

02:00.700 --> 02:01.980
we're gonna look for C-Sharp

02:05.220 --> 02:10.110
and go and grab this one that's been downloaded nearly 10 million times.

02:17.760 --> 02:22.980
It's another visual studio code installed along with the extension I'm going to open up to a local folder

02:22.980 --> 02:27.650
so I have my my dot net core folder inside of here.

02:27.660 --> 02:33.270
And let's go ahead and I want to right click here and I'm going to say open the terminal and this is

02:33.270 --> 02:36.250
going to open it up down here I'm receiving it just a little bit there.

02:39.750 --> 02:39.980
OK.

02:40.100 --> 02:46.830
So this opens up in the terminals and I have this dot net command I can say dot net new console.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.150
And this is going to go and create a new console app right inside the folder.

02:50.680 --> 02:57.230
And once we do that you're going to see that crazy bunch of files here in the fall.

02:57.280 --> 03:02.080
It has the actual C-Sharp code is inside this program that C-s it's just simply one main function that's

03:02.080 --> 03:04.690
writing out console Hello world.

03:04.830 --> 03:09.100
And in order to fire this of what you want to do is go to your little debug menu.

03:09.180 --> 03:13.290
You're going to do it from the dropdown menu select Add configuration.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.200
You're going to select dotnet core.

03:15.240 --> 03:19.900
This is going to create a configuration file for you you don't want to touch any of that right now.

03:19.890 --> 03:22.110
Go ahead and click your documents again.

03:22.350 --> 03:23.910
Close this down.

03:23.910 --> 03:27.090
Double click on your program file.

03:27.240 --> 03:32.920
Go back to the click on the debugger and then you click and press play.

03:32.940 --> 03:37.860
This is going to go through and it's going to compile your application to machine code that the Mac

03:37.860 --> 03:43.200
understands and it's going to then execute on your terminal and you can see the output of the program

03:43.700 --> 03:45.090
is Hello world.

03:45.090 --> 03:48.440
So that's how you get set up with dotnet core on a Mac.

03:48.630 --> 03:55.260
It's going to be a very similar experience for Linux as well so just use Visual Studio code with the

03:55.260 --> 03:59.400
C-sharp extension the Donek or a library and you're good to go.

04:02.440 --> 04:07.110
So if you guys are looking to learn more about gotten Accor makes you guys check out of this the.

04:07.120 --> 04:11.920
So I have the link in the description tab below and it's $100 but it's actually going to be on sale

04:11.920 --> 04:17.140
for everybody that's looking at this video and that's going to click on the link in the description

04:17.140 --> 04:18.320
tab.

04:18.430 --> 04:22.140
This course actually covers everything you need to know getting started with C-sharp.

04:22.140 --> 04:23.270
It's going to be cross-platform.

04:23.270 --> 04:27.760
So now that I've showed you how to actually get it installed on Mac you can do the same thing with Linux.

04:27.760 --> 04:33.640
The course itself is using Visual Studio and the Integrated Development Environment which only works

04:33.640 --> 04:34.210
on Windows.

04:34.210 --> 04:40.510
But again you could use Visual Studio code with the C-sharp extension and it's basically the same experience

04:41.740 --> 04:48.210
but all cover and version control razor templates single page Obstat site generators things like that.

04:48.270 --> 04:53.680
There is even going to be some you know a lot of a lot of stuff on the razor validation forum posting

04:53.680 --> 04:56.990
Ajax posting web API.

04:57.220 --> 04:58.990
So just make sure you guys check that out.

04:58.990 --> 05:02.670
It covers a lot and that I have other courses available as well.

05:02.710 --> 05:07.330
So if you guys are interested in Python or other types of development let me know.

05:07.330 --> 05:08.060
Thanks guys.

05:08.060 --> 05:08.300
Bye.
