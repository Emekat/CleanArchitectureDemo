Hey guys what about going back on this video.

00:02.020 --> 00:06.720
Let's go and touch the models and let's go and create our first model and find out how to actually send

00:06.720 --> 00:09.330
them back to our view.

00:09.330 --> 00:14.490
So in our controllers here you can see that it actually just returns the standard view for our home

00:14.490 --> 00:14.970
controller.

00:14.970 --> 00:18.200
We want to add a model and the model.

00:18.210 --> 00:22.860
We're just going to have it'll be a new class and we'll just call this

00:25.840 --> 00:27.040
what does say it's like a book.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.250
So we're just call it a book a book.

00:29.250 --> 00:33.900
So what does books have they have a couple of properties on and this is where we actually define what

00:33.900 --> 00:38.920
are the modeled properties that we're going to have around the public string title.

00:38.970 --> 00:40.710
Because every book has a title.

00:41.160 --> 00:47.570
And then for now we're going have a public string of author.

00:47.760 --> 00:48.430
All right.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.140
There we go.

00:51.140 --> 00:58.110
So now that we have this model define what we can do is we can now create a separate controller.

00:59.930 --> 01:01.780
And before we even do that well you know what

01:04.760 --> 01:09.380
I want to show you guys you know I'm going to show you because I don't want to show you guys the scaffolding

01:09.380 --> 01:12.140
because the scaffolding doesn't actually show you what's going on behind the scenes.

01:12.140 --> 01:12.830
Let's go at it.

01:12.830 --> 01:15.710
The actual home.

01:16.220 --> 01:19.410
Let's go ahead and pass down the model here to our viewers of what we're going to do is we're going

01:19.420 --> 01:20.610
to say you know what.

01:20.700 --> 01:28.220
Instead of our method here we're going to go and we're going to do a we're just call this new model

01:28.850 --> 01:30.970
to be the scripted equals the new.

01:30.980 --> 01:32.630
And then it's the name of our model.

01:32.630 --> 01:34.340
So it's a new book.

01:34.340 --> 01:34.600
All right.

01:34.610 --> 01:38.060
So by saying that you're gonna get these squiggly lines and we double click on that you're going to

01:38.060 --> 01:43.020
see that it's actually going to say you need to use your first application models.

01:43.130 --> 01:44.780
So that way we know what the book is.

01:44.780 --> 01:50.510
Now they know what the book is in fact we can even do shorthand stanch the actual values here so we're

01:50.510 --> 01:55.960
going to say the title equals Chris is great.

01:56.540 --> 01:57.950
And I actually don't think that.

01:57.950 --> 01:58.630
But anyway.

01:58.640 --> 02:04.160
And then the author is Chris Hall.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.250
There we go.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.340
So it's grown to do a semicolon there.

02:08.340 --> 02:09.620
It's not going to hurt anything.

02:09.650 --> 02:14.470
And then in order to pass the model to our view we just have to say a new model.

02:14.780 --> 02:19.780
All right so now if we go and we run the application then we go to the actual page.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.990
We're going to see that there's really no no no difference here.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.510
But I just want to show you why.

02:24.860 --> 02:30.490
So if we go to Home Index you're going to see that it's just delivering up the standard.

02:30.500 --> 02:35.000
You know there's really no change in the reason why is because we're not actually using our model so

02:35.000 --> 02:37.660
in order to actually really use our model inside of here.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.840
So in order to do that all we need to do is just reference our model and we're going to use this keyword

02:41.920 --> 02:46.400
the model keyword and then we just have to go in and spell out to where it can be found.

02:46.400 --> 02:52.880
The first application that models dot books and other we have that in here we can now use this model

02:52.880 --> 02:58.400
inside of our templates instead of this hello from NBC we're going to actually reference the model so

02:58.770 --> 03:05.960
it razor Shoreham by convention as you're going to want to you could just actually say model dot but

03:05.960 --> 03:06.470
it should need.

03:06.530 --> 03:08.330
There needs to be an at symbol for anything.

03:08.340 --> 03:12.830
There to a model dot and you can see clearly that we have an author and a title on here so we're going

03:12.830 --> 03:19.720
to say author that title and then instead of a paragraph tag we'll just say model dots author.

03:19.730 --> 03:25.730
All right so you can see once you reference your model you can now reference the actual data.

03:25.730 --> 03:31.910
Now this actual template engine that comes with dot net and it's come with a b c dot it for a long time.

03:31.940 --> 03:35.980
It's called the razor template engine and it's server side code that is generated.

03:36.030 --> 03:40.990
And essentially it is building up a bunch HTL and passing it back from the server.

03:41.060 --> 03:48.950
All this razor stuff is processed on the server and it's just it's a very convenient way for most web

03:48.950 --> 03:55.320
applications that need basic template and so now that we reference was going run the application see

03:55.320 --> 03:58.650
if we can actually get those values that we're passing and if you remember correctly I think it was

03:58.650 --> 04:03.390
Chris's grade or something like that and then Chris Hawkes is the author so let's go out and check out

04:03.390 --> 04:04.590
the home index method.

04:04.650 --> 04:05.790
And there it is Chris is great.

04:05.790 --> 04:08.650
Chris Hawkster that's dynamic data and that's good.

04:08.670 --> 04:14.880
It's coming from the controller So obviously this template right here can be re-used over and over and

04:14.880 --> 04:16.000
over again.

04:16.200 --> 04:22.890
And because it's just referencing these you know variable placeholders it's dynamic meaning that it

04:22.890 --> 04:25.800
responds differently based on the values that you pass into it.

04:25.800 --> 04:30.720
So this value itself is obviously hard coded into the controller but most likely you're going to be

04:30.720 --> 04:35.520
reaching out to some sort of database or something like that and getting whatever sort of data was requested

04:35.520 --> 04:37.290
and returned to the template.
