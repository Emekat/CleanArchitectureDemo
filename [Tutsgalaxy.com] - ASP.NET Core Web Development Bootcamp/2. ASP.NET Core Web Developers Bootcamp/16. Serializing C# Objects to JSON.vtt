00:00.870 --> 00:06.030
So there is a difference between C-Sharp classes in javascript objects and unfortunately you can't just

00:06.030 --> 00:10.920
send down C sharp object across the wire and expect that the browser is going to understand what to

00:10.920 --> 00:11.840
do with it.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.940
So they speak the common language they both understand which is the J on data format.

00:17.070 --> 00:18.930
And there is a project called Jay Sankar.

00:19.050 --> 00:23.230
So we're going to look at installing a package and what we do is we go to our tools and we're going

00:23.230 --> 00:26.990
to go into Newgate package manager and then go into the console.

00:27.890 --> 00:31.410
And we're going to be searching for a project called J.

00:31.730 --> 00:34.270
And that is actually in fact I didn't really want to.

00:34.300 --> 00:41.560
So I want to be the manager of the package for the solution and this is where we're going to go.

00:41.560 --> 00:50.760
I'm going to browse on here and here I can say on dot net and you can see here and there in Safdar Jason.

00:50.790 --> 00:55.730
So this is actually faster than Microsoft's built in serialization here.

00:55.730 --> 01:00.240
So what you're going to want to do is you want to just say I want to add it to my first project or my

01:00.240 --> 01:02.980
first application project and I just simply install.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.810
So if you guys ever use new warriors like would know this is the same thing get as Microsoft's package

01:09.810 --> 01:10.670
manager.

01:11.130 --> 01:17.120
And if you're coming from a Python background then it would be like pip are Sadan that we have that

01:17.120 --> 01:22.310
included in our project we can go out and close this down and on the band object here what I'm going

01:22.310 --> 01:28.840
to do is I'm a Serializer to Jason and I'm going to use this library that we just we just installed

01:28.850 --> 01:34.950
so it's going to say J-Zone convert and then we're going to say serialise

01:39.760 --> 01:47.200
and then we Serializer band objects so we need to import the raisons say using Noonan's oncogenes on.

01:47.320 --> 01:55.150
And so it's actually not serialized it's serialized objects and they're going to have to bring this.

01:55.150 --> 01:57.770
And so anyway there's a lot of different library sets.

01:57.790 --> 02:01.900
It's difficult to keep up with all of them but if you hover over you can see that the serialise is the

02:01.900 --> 02:06.280
specified object to use on string.

02:06.290 --> 02:10.280
So what I want to show you guys if you actually run the server after making a change to the code.

02:10.460 --> 02:14.480
And if you look at your console one we made the AJAX call you're going to see that we get this error

02:14.480 --> 02:17.960
message and by clicking on it it's actually going to pull up the error message which you actually want

02:17.960 --> 02:21.860
to see and hear here you can just see that we're getting the standard that the view is not found.

02:21.950 --> 02:27.470
And the reason why is if we go back over to the controller you can see that it's expecting an action

02:27.470 --> 02:33.510
result type to be returned which is a return view but a view is actually returning a bunch of H to him

02:33.510 --> 02:36.950
all characters and things and we just want to return it on a string.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.160
So what I can do here is I could change this.

02:39.170 --> 02:44.300
I could stop the server and I can change this over to a J sound result.

02:45.770 --> 02:49.600
And then I could say return JS on.

02:49.840 --> 02:54.600
And then you just simply say you know you see Serializer just like we did before.

02:55.830 --> 03:00.170
And now by making that change you can see instead of giving the 500 error we're actually returning the

03:00.180 --> 03:02.280
Jason string that we're looking for.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.570
So inside of your javascript you can see all these forward slash characters what you would end up doing

03:06.570 --> 03:10.970
as you would end up then based Jaison parsing it from within your age to him.

03:10.980 --> 03:16.110
So if we go back over to the aged him here and go into the details page and here where we're Konsole

03:16.110 --> 03:18.570
logging and you can see we're Jaison string a fine.

03:18.580 --> 03:19.530
But let's just not do that.

03:19.530 --> 03:23.280
It's actually because really we don't we want an actual object.

03:23.400 --> 03:28.000
For the most part that's what we're going to use for any sort of modern you why it's going to take an

03:28.730 --> 03:30.110
object.

03:30.180 --> 03:34.380
So if we make that change very refreshed you can see that we're now getting a straight face on data

03:34.380 --> 03:35.120
object back.
